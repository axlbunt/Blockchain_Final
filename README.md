1. Connect the website to the wallet


2. Seller selects one of the property and click on Buy. Buyer needs to pay 20% down payment in Ether.


3. The Crypto Wallet "Metatmask" pops up with the buyer account and the buy transaction is initiated


4. Once the buy transaction is passed in Metamask, User Selects the Inspector Wallet address and the inspection transaction is completed.
